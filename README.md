# Portfolio

Hi There,

I'm a novice at GitHub, I used to be a UX Desginer and somehow determined to learn how to code, so that I can better understand how to create a website or a application step by step.
And ultimately, I intend to build my own website where I could share my porfolio and stories.

I can't wait to commence my journey in GitHub.
