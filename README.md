# Portfolio

Hi There,

I'm a novice at GitHub, I used to be a UX Desginer and somehow determined to learn how to code, so that I can better understand how to create a website or a application step by step.
And ultimately, I intend to build my own website where I could share my porfolio and stories.

I can't wait to commence my journey in GitHub.

Always telling a truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people.

According to a latest research by an authoritative psycological insititution, people tell eight lies or so per day, intentionally or unintentionally.Can you believe that?No matter how much you doubt it like I do,that's the truth which no one can deny.As a consequence, I begin to take it seriously and count how many lies I tell every day.The number is actually less than eight but pretty close.

Ultimately, I can't help to think why human lies.Take myself as an instance and look back to my past, I was literally a professional lier.I used to lie to my mother when I was in junior school, I was obessed with Internet games just like all the other classmates, and personal computer has not been applied massively back to that time, the only way I could access to computer was the internet cafeteria, which costed a plenty of money, and that was definitely beyond a student's affordability.
In order to get more moneyï¼ŒI deceived my mum. I've got a load of excuses like I lost my money carelessly,I bought some cosy snacks and so on.With the lie became bigger, thing was getting worse. And finally I was caught by mum when I was focus on playing that so-called "Fantasy" game right in front of the glowing screen in the cafe. At that moment I expected an outrage or a curse, but suprisedly, Mum behaved pretty calm and said nothing. All I can saw is the considerable disappointment inside her eyes which I could never forget in my life, and that was the first time I realized that I've deeply broken her heart.

Judging from my own experience, people deceive to take advantage of something or somebody.If that goes with somebody,lies indicates the very beginning of hurting his/her feeling,and that is when you begin to push him/her away and you can hardly gain his/her heart back.It's easy to imagine how you feel when someone you care lie to you,it hurts, doesn't it?
So, no more lies and always tell the truth in any relationship between people, especially someone you love.
